Program Description:
Design a class that has an array of floating-point numbers. The constructor should accept an
integer argument and dynamically allocate the array to hold that many numbers. The destructor
should free the memory held by the array. In addition, there should be member functions to
perform the following operations:
• Store a number in any element of the array
• Retrieve a number from any element of the array
• Return the highest value stored in the array
• Return the lowest value stored in the array
• Return the average of all the numbers stored in the array
Demonstrate the class in a program.
ADT for NumberArray Class
Note – you can change the function names and variable identifiers, the names provided here
are for illustrative purposes (although you can use them if you want to).
Domain – A positive integer to hold the size of the array. This integer should have a default
value assigned. A pointer to double to access the memory for the dynamic array. The array
values are to be be initialized to 0.
Operations
1. Include a constructor with the size of the array as a parameter. Assign the default size to
this parameter which will be the size of the array if it the constructor is called with no
parameters. The parameter provided by a client will serve as the size of the array if supplied.
Here is an example prototype for the constructor
This constructor should set the size of the array based on the default or the client input,
allocate the storage for the array and store the address in the pointer variable, then fill the
array with zeros.
Here is an example prototype for this constructor:
NumberArray(int size = MAX_SIZE);
The default size, MAX_SIZE is an integer constant. Declare it as static in the header file so
you can assign it a value. This makes it easy to change the default size if needed.
2. Include a destructor to release the memory allocated by the objects when they go out of
scope. Print a message from the destructor showing that it has run (this is not usual, most of
the time destructors are silent).
3. Write a member function to store a number in any element of the array. The function takes
the array index and the value to store. This is a mutator function, so the index supplied by
the client must be validated to ensure that it is within the bounds of the array. If it is not,
write an error message and don’t store the value. If it’s valid, store the number at the
